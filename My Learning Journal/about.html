                After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've 
                made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo 
                Projects projects and meet lie-minded peers.

                made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo

            <h4 class="first-heading">How I stay committed to learning</h4>
            <p>
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and 
                hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or 
                work new techniques into existing projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was 
                learning and most things about my journey with the world.
            </p>
            <h4>How I got started</h4>
            <p>
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take 
                notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my 
                notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries 
                of what I learned using my own words.
            </p>
            <p>
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my 
                learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
